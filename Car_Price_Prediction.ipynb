# Car Price Prediction

## Objective
To build a machine learning model that predicts the selling price of a used car
based on features such as year, present price, kilometers driven, fuel type,
selling type, transmission, and ownership.

## Dataset
The dataset contains car-related information including:
- Year
- Present Price
- Driven Kilometers
- Fuel Type
- Selling Type
- Transmission
- Owner
- Selling Price (Target)

## Tools & Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Google Colab

## Steps Performed
1. Imported required libraries
2. Loaded and explored the dataset
3. Checked missing values
4. Performed feature encoding
5. Split data into training and testing sets
6. Trained a machine learning regression model
7. Evaluated the model using R², MAE, MSE, RMSE
8. Predicted car prices for new inputs

## Results
The model achieved high accuracy with a strong R² score,
indicating good prediction performance.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates a real-world regression problem
and improves understanding of data preprocessing,
feature engineering, and model evaluation.
